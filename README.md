## üìñ About The Project

GameLog is a robust console application (CLI) developed in Java that functions as a "Pok√©dex" for your video game collection. The application allows you to search for any existing game using the public RAWG API, save its details to a local SQLite database, and manage your personal collection with different statuses.

This project was built from scratch with a focus on software architecture best practices, including a layered structure, separation of concerns, and a robust data persistence layer.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Game Search:** Search a catalog of over 500,000 games in real-time using the RAWG API.

* **Full CRUD Functionality:** Complete features to Create, Read, Update (the status), and Delete games from your collection.
* **Filter by Status:** Easily view your collection by filtering for a specific status.
* **Polished Console Interface:** A clean and robust user experience with clear menus and input error handling.
